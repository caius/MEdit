# MEdit

My first app using the WebOS SDK with the enyo frameworkâ€”a markdown editor. So far you can type text in and it doesn't do much else. (Or save what you've typed.)

## Todo

* Sort out displaying the rendered markdown
* Implement some sort of document picker
* Implement a datastore (dropbox?)
